      "[\"welcome to the huberman Lab podcastwhere we discuss science andscience-based tools for everyday lifeI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professorof neurobiology and Ophthalmology atStanford school of medicine today myguest is Dr Sarah Gottfried Dr SarahGottfried is an obstetriciangynecologist who did her undergraduatetraining in bioengineering at theUniversity of Washington in Seattle shethen completed her medical training atHarvard Medical School and she currentlyis a clinical professor of IntegrativeMedicine and nutritional Sciences atThomas Jefferson University she has alsobeen a clinician treating men and womenin various aspects of Hormone Health andLongevity for more than 20 yearsshe is an expert in not just traditionalmedicine as it relates to hormones andfertility but also nutritional practicessupplementation and behavioral practicesand combining all of that expertise inorder to help women navigate everyaspect and dimension of their hormoneslongevity and vitality ranging frompuberty to Young adulthood adulthoodperimenopause and menopause and nowadaysshe's also treating men across thelifespan in terms of longevity vitalityand Hormone Health during today'sdiscussion Dr Gottfried shares anenormous amount of information and toolsthat women can apply toward theirHormone Health fertility vitality andlongevity we discussed the gutmicrobiome which many people have heardabout but Dr Godfrey points out thespecific needs that women have in termsof managing their gut microbiome and theways that that influences things likeestrogen levels and Metabolismtestosterone thyroid and growth hormoneand much more we also discussednutrition and exercise we touch on howthe omega-3 fatty acids play aparticularly important role in managingfemale hormone Health Dr Gottfriedpoints out why women have particularneeds when it comes to essential fattyacids and how best to obtain thoseessential fatty acids for Hormone Healthwe also discuss exercise and she offerssome surprising information about thetypes and ratios of resistance trainingto cardiovascular training that womenought to use in order to maximize theirHormone Healthwe also talk a lot about the digestivesystem this was a surprising aspect ofthe conversation I did not anticipate DrGottfried shared with us for instancethat women suffer from digestive issuesat more than 10 times the frequency thatdo men and fortunately that there aretools specific to women that they canuse in order to overcome those digestiveissues and that in overcoming thosedigestive issues they can overcome manyof the related hormone issues that somany women face Dr Gottfried also shareswith you tremendous knowledge about thespecific types of tests not just bloodtests but also urine and microbiometests that women can use in order toreally get a clear understanding oftheir hormone status not just of presentbut also where the trajectory of theirhormones is taking them so we have anavid discussion about puberty aboutyoung adulthood adulthood perimenopauseand how best to manage and navigateperimenopause and menopause including adiscussion about hormone replacementtherapy in addition to her academic andclinical expertise Dr Gottfried hasauthored many import important books onnutrition hormones and supplementationas it relates to women and to peoplegenerally the two books that I'd like tohighlight and that we've provided linksto in the show note captions are womenfood and hormones and the hormone cure Iread the hormone cure and found it to betremendously interesting and informativenot just in terms of teaching me aboutfemale hormone health and varioustreatments for female hormone Health butalso as a man trying to understand howthe endocrine system interacts withmindset nutrition and supplementationmore generally so I highly recommend thehormone cure for anybody interested inhormones and Hormone Health and womenfood and hormones in particular forwomen although again both books aregoing to be strongly informative forwomen wishing to optimize their HormoneHealth vitality and Longevity before webegin I'd like to emphasize that thispodcast is separate from my teaching andresearch roles at Stanford it is howeverpart of my desire and effort to bringzero cost to Consumer information aboutscience and science related tools to thegeneral public in keeping with thattheme I'd like to thank the sponsors oftoday's podcast cast our first sponsoris Roka Roka makes eyeglasses andsunglasses that are the absolute highestquality I spent a lifetime working onthe biology of the visual system and Ican tell you that your visual system hasto contend with an enormous number ofchallenges in order for you to be ableto see clearly so for instance when yougo from a very brightly lit area to adimlet area your visual system has tomake all sorts of adjustments that allowyou to still see your environment Rocaeyeglasses and sunglasses were builtwith the biology of the visual system inmind so no matter what environmentyou're in you'll be able to see withperfect clarity and they have terrificAesthetics an enormous number of choicesin terms of\", \"

slashhuberman and now for my discussion withDr Sarah Gottfried Dr Gottfried Sarahwelcome thank you so happy to be hereyeah I'm delighted and very excited toask you about an enormous number oftopics here we are expert in so so manythings so uh the challenge for me isgoing to be to constrain this walk as itwere but I'm hoping that we can touch ona great number of things today the firstof whichis really abouthormones and female hormones inparticular and I have a question whichisis it ever informative for a womanregardless of age to know somethingabouther mother's perhaps even hergrandmother's experience vis-a-vishormones not just pregnancychallenges with orum ease with pregnancy and child rearingchildbirth this sort of thing but youknow what sorts of conversations shouldwomen be having with themselves and withfamily members to get a window into whattheir specific needs might be love thisquestionso my work is really at the interfacebetween genetics and environment so yourquestion gets tobothand I think it's essential that youunderstandwhat yourgrandmother went through I'd even sayyour great grandmother depending onlongevity in your family so I grew upwith my great-grandmother I get thatand especially your mother\", \"soI would probably start first with traumaan intergenerational trauma because Ithink that affects the endocrine systemso hugely especially cortisol signalingbutthe broader Pine systempsychoimmunuroendocrine systemand then there's you know if I thinkaboutthe stages the life cycle that a womangoes throughif you think about puberty I think Idon't know howgenetically determine the age of pubertyis certainly there's a lot ofenvironmental influences like toxins canaffect itbutum pregnancythe age at which you start to go throughperimenopause menopause many of thosehave a genetic componentso with pregnancy I mean you cancertainly thinkthe shape of the pelvis your ability tohave a vaginal birthsome of that is genetically determined Imean you do have you know the the spermdonor affecting some of that but youknow in my family for instance we haveno cesarean sections so everyone goesthrough this process of a relativelyeasy vaginal birth I was a forceps babybut you know for the most partum you can find out about that and thenthere's certain female conditions thathave a very strong component geneticallymost of which run in my family so thatincludes endometriosisfibroids I just had a hysterectomy Iadded 50 plus fibroidsand polycystic ovarian syndromeand of those three uh how frequent arethose and maybe I can constrain thequestion a little bit by sayingum today's discussion I imagine is goingto be heard by men and women of allsorts of Ages so I uh maybe I'll directthe question a little bit toward youknow at what age should thesediscussions startum you know we always imagine that womenin their 30s and 40s and 50s and onwardshould be getting certain tests andaddressing things like uh ovarianreserve and and other sorts of thingsbut you know maybe we could Marchthrough and just say for a woman in herteens who's already hit puberty whatsorts of biomarkers whether or notthey're blood-based or per orum phenotyping you know the outwardappearance of uhshould those young women be payingattention to likewise for women in their20s 30s maybe we could take it more orless by by decade at starting at pubertyassuming that woman hits pubertysometime what between what is it now theaverage in the U.S is somewhere between12 and 16 years old do I have that rightno you do not oh great so that's to bewrong so so it used to be 12 to 16. Iwould say 50 years agoit's been moving younger and we thinksome of that is related to toxinexposure as I mentioned but I was 10when I went through puberty so uh well Ishould say menarchy and I startedgrowing breasts much before that soI thinknow I'm going to step away from thescience for a moment I'm going to dothat pretty fluidly and I'll try to callit outI think there's also a huge influencefrom stressand like the development of the adrenalglandsso going back to the sciencethe issue in teenage years is that thehypothalamic pituitary adrenal axisand I like to think of it broader sostay with me hypothalamic pituitaryadrenal gonadol a recent women testesmenthyroidgut axisso that to me is the control system soI'm kind ofexpressing my bioengineering side herewell I think it's great to include theother organs and tissue systems of thebody because as we both know that thenarrow definition of just hypothalamicpituitary adrenal it can't be just thatright no it can't no yeah it doesn'ttell the whole storyso if you look atthethe main sex hormonesin a a young woman who's in her teenageyears the hypothalamic pituitary adrenalgonadal part of that is not fully matureso they're more likely to skip periodsespecially under stress they have a lotof influences it really doesn't get wellestablished until you're done withadolescence and I'm told thatadolescence now is still like age 25 to26. I heard that and I was like I've gottwo daughters and I was like that's areally long time and not just apsychologically defined or biopsychosocial mostly psychologicallydefined I heard that from a psychologistsobiomarkers you asked about in yourteenage years what I think is reallyinteresting is to look at cortisolto look at the dance between estrogenand progesterone in those years is lesshelpful because I think there's a lot ofvariability due to the immaturity of thesystem if you've got someone who's gotreally regular periods it's probablybetter to do some benchmarking at thatage but generally I find thatbenchmarkingis best performed in your 20s or 30s areperiods not that regular\", \" in terms ofduration of the menstrual cycle when themenstrual cycle first sets init depends so I was like clockwork every28 days until I had my hysterectomy inAugustsame thing with my daughters I've gottwo daughters one's 17 the other is 23.for a lot of women they're not regularand then there's the whole piece of oralcontraceptives and other forms ofcontraception where you have no ideawhat the normal cycle is and I hopewe'll have some time to talk a littlebit about oral contraceptives because Ithink it isthis is now opinion again and notscience I think it is the number oneendocrinopathythat is iatrogenic for women uh we willdefinitely talk about it I get a lot ofquestions about oral contraceptivesum in the social media space and alsoquestions about iuds quite a lot totallyin particular copper iudsnon-non-hormonal IUD so we willdefinitely touch on that I'm an IUDCrusader so I just want to you know giveyou that warning you're you're a fan doI have that right or you're anti I am ahuge fan which iuds in particular so Ilike copper because it's non-hormonalit's as effective as getting your tubesdyed who would have thought right I meanit's that toxic to the sperm Mobility isthat how it works that's myunderstanding of it is that that it thatit basically it's like amore or less an electric fence to thethe sperm cap and just that's itelectric fence is a bit of a harshanalogy but I'll work with thatbut it'sit's for 10 years so that you reallyhavecomplete autonomy and sovereignty overyour sexual lifethat's profound and to not get all thoseDownstream risks they're associated witha birth control pill the other thingthat's important to know about it I knowthis is a sidebarwomen who use the copper IUDhave the highest satisfaction rate ofanyone on contraceptives the highestsatisfaction rate and yet it is theleast used of all forms of contraceptionnow my favorite is vasectomybut short of vasectomy I think the IEDis a really great choice there are somerisks associated with it I'm not sayingit's risk-free but I love IUD and I loveit for younger women too because it usedto be that when I went through mytraining which was 30 years ago we weretold you know don't put it in someonewho hasn't had a babyand that is patriarchal messagingbut getting back to your originalquestion which is about biomarkers perdecadein your 20sthat's when you want to do some basecasing with estrogen progesterone andtestosteroneso I think it's really helpful to knowabout this this Tango you're fromArgentina or your father I haveArgentine lineage yes my grandparentsdid Tango into their late 80s I I am I'min my late 40s and I I still haven'tstarted so I suppose there's time itmight be time for you to okay and itmight be a factor in their longevity didthey have good health span and mygrandfather Smoked Cigarettes dailyremained mentally sharp until he died inhis late 90s but um almost burned downtheir apartment several times fallingasleep with a cigarette in his mouth soI don't recommend anyone Smoke by theway uh but it was uh coffee mate uh redmeat and cigarettes and they lived intotheir 90s so that side of my family hasthe genetic Advantage the other sideless soum but in any event uh Tangoum is a 2023 goal it has been every yearum the uh I'm gonna hold you accountabletoday okay we'll do and there no therewill be no YouTube video of me do atleast not initially Tim Ferriss actuallya phenomenal podcaster as we know is uhhe's a badass he's a badass Tango Tangodancer I know this through varioussources yes yeah I've seen yeah so thisTango between us and progesterone isincredibly important you want to havethe right lead do you want to have theright follow between the two hormonesagain I'm stepping away from my sciencehat but what happens a lot of the timeis that estrogen dominates in that Tangoand when that happens it sets you up forgreater risk of fibroids endometriosisbreast painprobably in association with themicrobiome and the estrobolume can youfamiliarize me with the estrobloom yeahI'm delighted to know that I don'trecognize the term yeah so theestrobolume is the set of microbesin and their DNA their DNA mostlyin the gut microbiome that set ofmicrobes in their DNA so it's in theif you look at the totalitythe subsetof particular bacteria modulate estrogenlevelsso a lot of this work was\", \" spearheaded byMartin Glaserandwhat we know is that there are somewomen who have an estrobolume that makesthem have a greater risk of certainestrogen mediatedconditions like breast cancerendometrial cancerand a men prostate cancerso the estrobulum is incrediblyimportant there's not a lot of attentionpaid to it but I always think in termsof my patients you know could this besomeone who's got a faulty a strobe andwe need to adjust it with you know someof the microbiomemodulatinguh nutrients nutraceuticals that we haveso that they're less likely to have thatthat Tango that's not working withestrogen progesterone so getting back tothe biomarkersif if you gave me an unlimited budgetwhich I kind of have with some of myum clients that I work with nowwhat I would want to know isestrogen progesterone testosterone and Iwant the timing right for thatI'd want to know about DHEA and sort ofthe whole Anderson pathway I'd want toknow about the metabolites of estrogenbecause some of them are protective andvery helpful others are a bit likeHomer Simpson I mean they're just likecausing all kinds of problems in yourbody increasing the risk of Quinoneslike DNA damage and potentially anincreased risk of breast cancer althoughthat data I think is mixedI'd also like to know about their stoolso I want to know about the microbiomeso the best that we have right now is tolook uh when we do stool testing I do alot of stool testing we can look atthings like beta glucoronidaseare you familiar with BG I'm familiarwith it as a term and so for thoselistening it very often not always whenyou hear an ace ASE you're dealing withan enzyme so we can take a stab thereand and it sounds like it's somehowinvolved inum glucose metabolism of some sort or isit clickeronautation so it's involved inwhen you produce estrogen in the bodythis is like the simplified version butwhen you produce estrogen you are meantto use it like send it to The receptorswhere it's meant to go and then lose itlike you don't want to keeprecirculating the estrogen like BadKarma and that's what happens withpeople who have high blade betagluconidase so it's this enzyme that'sproduced by three bacteria in particularin the gut and I see a lot of men andwomen who have elevated betaglucuronidase and then they have someestrogen dominance related to that isthat the total reason we don't reallyknow but it's one of the drivers it'sone of the levers and it can be detectedfrom a microbiome AKA stool samplethat's right and in terms of bloodtesting or various tests for these otherbiomarkers getting estrogen testosteroneand other ratios I realize there arepeople have different means financialmeans but in general people wanting todo a blood test it sounds like they'regoing to need to do it what women willneed to do it at different stages oftheir menstrual cycle if they had topick oneyou know either in the follicular phaseand or in the luteal stage of theirovarian menstrual cycle excuse meovulatory menstrual cyclewhen would you suggest they do that ifthey had to pick one so if you forced meto pick one I would sayprobably day 21 to 22 for someone in her20s so we're focused right now in thatdecadeso for most women they've got amenstrual cycle Dave that averages outat 28 days so this is about a weekbefore they start their periodfor women or more irregular it's harderto do that as women get older and we'lltalk about this in a momentusually the cycle gets a little shorterso as they start to decline in theirprogesterone production their periodgets a little closer together like minebefore August was about every 26 dayssoat that point you want to test soonerlike day 1920 and I'm not talking aboutblood tests so a blood test is thecheapest thing it's usually what'scovered by insurance but my preferencewould be to do dried urineI like to use saliva for cortisol I liketo use dried urine so that I getmetabolomics in addition to the levelsof these hormones and if I'm forced toI'll use blood testing and that'scertainly the gold standardfor all of these hormones that we'retalking aboutbutum it's not as comprehensive and as youknow it's a quick little snapshot whilethe needle's in your vein for you know30 seconds yeah the salivary cortisolmakes sense to me because myunderstanding is that you get freecortisol which is the active cortisolyou said with urine you're also gettingthe metabolites that's right and thenum for blood testing you're getting itit's sort of a crude window into theaverages ecstatic total levelso uh let me\", \" go back and say one otherthing about biomarkers a big part of thetesting that I do in phenotyping mypatients I practice Precision medicineso I I like toalmost start with nutritional testingI don't think I've ever had a teenagerI've got some NBA players that are 19 2021 so maybe those countbut uh those are men obviously but fornutritional testingthat would be a potentially a helpfulthing to do in your 20s becomes lessimportant as you get older and youdevelop more micronutrient deficienciesbut micronutrients play a huge role interms of hormone production magnesiumyou know the Magnesium is hugelyinvolved in the way that you get rid ofestrogen as an exampleso micronutrient testing what I usuallydo is a combination of blood and urineand so I'm looking at all of themicronutrients that we can measure thathave some clinical scientific basisbehind themif I could do that for a teenager Ithink it might be helpful becauseI recently gave a lecture on breastcancer risk reductionanother quick sidebarand I was sad to find thatintake of vegetables polyphenols is suchan important predictor a future risk ofbreast cancer like when you're a 50 60plus and the most important time is whenyou're a teenagernow I have one daughter that eatsvegetables she loves them and I haveanother daughter who eats food that'sbeige and it's very hard to get her toeat the volume of vegetables you knowfive colors a day which is what I doandif you have evidence that you could showa 17 year old that they've gotmicronutrient gapsI think that would be a motivator forthem to eat differently at a time whenit's so criticaleven though it's you know 25 years inthe future that it's going topotentially change this Arc that they'reonwhat do you do for a young woman whodoesn't like vegetables is or is notsomehow able or willing to to get thosefive colors a day of vegetable to helpsupport the microbiomeyou know our supplements a useful toolin that caseum what other sorts of tools Behavioralor otherwise are useful such a goodquestion so here I'm going to invoke RobKnight at UCSDso I think his his uh his gut projecthas really been helpful in terms ofunderstanding what kind of modulatorsare going to be importantso what I try to get that person to doand I don't see many teens anymore otherthan NBA playerswhat I try to get them to do is to havea smoothievery hard to get them to have a smoothieevery day but if I could get them tohave a smoothie three times a week andto throw some of these vegetables inthat makes a huge difference I mean weknow that makes a difference in terms ofmicrobiome change she should be blendingup broccoli or kale cauliflower socauliflower is great even they'reputting things into the Smoothie yeah Idon't know if you can get a teenager todo that but they often will use like Ihave them do steamed broccoli that's inthe freezer because it's got very littletasteso that they could do that in achocolate smoothie they could add somegreens I like greens powders are superconvenient so that with you know kind ofa taste that they like whether that'schocolate which is what most my clientswant or you know vanilla with berriesand that sort of thing so that can go along way if you don't like vegetablesand short of that I would say somesupplements but I would say that's adistant second to making a smoothie I'vegot one patient that I have to mentionbecauseumhe took us to the extreme so he is aretired physicist professor at UCSD hefound out that his microbiome was a hotmessand developed autoimmune disease and sohe became hell-bent like only aphysicist could on changing hismicrobiome and he dramatically shiftedit by having a smoothie every day with57 vegetables and fruits in it 57independent 57 independent soI mean this just warms my heart the waythat he did this but he would go to thefarmer's market he would just get abunch of this a bunch of thatand he would go home make the smoothieand then stick it in the freezer so he'dhave a serving every day and he became acompletely different person based onthis microbiome change hisuh autoimmune disease is in remissionhe umhe dropped a huge amount of weight hewent from being you know kind of thisphenotype that I know you know well of aprofessor High performing travelingaround the world on so many boards somuch Innovation so many great ideassuper computer guy to being someone whogets up in the morning gets in his hottub exercises for like one to two hoursa dayand then does a little work like hecompletely shifted the way that he livesand his microbiome shift you know whok\", \"nows what what's the chicken and whatthe what's the egg there but he had ahuge change in his physiology glucosewent from being quite high he hadand he tracks all of this of course it'slikeJupiter after all right and retired Isuppose might have had and he's retiredbut he is he's got the longest timeseries of anyone I knowand he's tracked his glucose and Insulingoing back 20 yearsso he can show you okay here's where Istarted having my smoothieand here's how my glucose and Insulinchanged as a result of that I'd like totake a quick break and acknowledge oneof our sponsors athletic greens athleticgreens now called ag1 is a vitaminmineral probiotic drink that covers allof your foundational nutritional needsI've been taking athletic greens since2012 so I'm delighted that they'responsoring the podcast the reason Istarted taking athletic greens and thereason I still take athletic greens onceare usually twice a day is that it getsto be the probiotics that I need for guthealth our gut is very important it'spopulated by gut microbiota thatcommunicate with the brain the immunesystem and basically all the biologicalsystems of our body to strongly impactour immediate and long-term healthand those probiotics and athletic greensare optimal and vital for microbiotichealth in addition athletic greenscontains a number of adaptogens vitaminsand minerals that make sure that all ofmy foundational nutritional needs aremet and it tastes great if you'd like totry athletic greens you can go toathleticgreens.com huberman and they'llgive you five free travel packs thatmake it really easy to mix up athleticgreens while you're on the road in thecar on the plane Etc and they'll giveyou a year's supply of vitamin d3k2again that's athleticgreens.com hubermanto get the five free travel packs andthe year supply of vitamin D3 K2 isthere a case for I'll say young womenbut young women and men usingover-the-counter probiotics as a way toenhance the microbiome this is somethingI hear about a lot I've heard thatexcessive doses of capsule probioticscan give a brain fog like conditionI personally don't use capsuleprobiotics unless I feel like my systemis under a significant amount of stressin which case I might add that in forbrief periods of time or if I've justtaken antibiotics for a period of timedo you ever recommend that the collegestudent or the high school student thatshe or he take capsule probioticsassuming that they're getting let's saythree to five servings of vegetables perday either in smoothie form or someother form what are your thoughts on onsupplementing probioticsit sounds like such a simple question itis such a complex answer and I don'tthink we really have the answer so I'lltell you the way that I approach itI look for randomized trials to supportmy use of probiotics and frankly I'munderwhelmedso I've seen some dataif I invoke myum NBA players for a momentalmost every player I've tested hasincreased intestinal permeability theyjust have such a high training loadprobably mediated by cortisol very highglucosis when they drain that they haveincreased intestinal permeability sothose tight junctions in their intestinebecome loose they develop a lot ofinflammation as a result of that andwhen you're a professional MBA playerand you're making 20 million a yearlike you don't want a lot ofinflammation you want a little bit tolike help your muscles recover but youdon't want it to beum adding to problems when you developan injury so this is leaky gut leaky gutyeah I don't love that term but yeahwe'll use it here so there's a there's aparticularprobiotic that is helpful in athleteswith leaky gut so that's the kind ofspecificity and randomized trial thatI'm looking forthe rest of itI think there's support if you find helpfrom it as you described if you take acourse of antibiotics I mean first ofall I would question whether you needthem but I try and avoid them there havebeen instances where they've beenprescribed and I took them mostly in thepast I was in college they seem likethey kind of gave them out you had asinus infection to give you Pro you knowantibiotics using like yeah the worsttreatment ever yeah so if you're comingoff of antibiotics I think that's a goodtime to do what we call replacement doseprobiotics I think what's far moreinteresting isprebiotics I think the data is muchbetter for prebiotics andum a selective use of polyphenolshow would a person in their teens and20s or any age for that matter knowwhat whether or not they havenutritional deficiencies what is thebest way to analyze if one\"]\n"
